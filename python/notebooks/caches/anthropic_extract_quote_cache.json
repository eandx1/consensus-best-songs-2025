It\u2019s a song about a man debating whether to upend his whole life to take a shot at true love, and one that finds time to drily reflect on the cowardice of Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca when faced with a similar dilemma. The lyrics are wry and witty, calling to mind John Prine or Townes Van Zandt, but it\u2019s the way the two singers\u2019 voices wind and curl around each other that elevates this to something close to holy. I later learned Pianovich wrote the song about falling for Morris, and while it\u2019s not necessary to know that in order to appreciate the couple\u2019s fine musicianship, the backstory does add another layer of romance to proceedings.

There, a dairy farm from the 1740s lingers.

It\u2019s about a noble, eastward lord imprisoned by a Turkish king and saved by the ruler\u2019s daughter. In keeping a long-held promise to her, he leaves his fianc\u00e9e for her seven years later. Drones, clinking glass, fiddle, synthesizers, and mouth harp skiffle and collapse in the softness. As Oliver Child-Lanning sings about forsaking \u201call for the Turkish lady, she has crossed that old salt sea for me,\u201d the tune\u2019s unorthodox \u201chappily ever after\u201d rockets into a drapery of found sounds, misty synths, and looping, discordant strings. \u201cLord Bateman\u201d is a fascinating, 21-minute heirloom captured on an \u201cad hoc signal chain\u201d in a house older than all of us combined. \u2014 Matt Mitchell"

As she tumbles vocally toward the end of the first verse, the theme shifts, inquisitively revealing the knight\u2019s hidden, earnest heart. As a plea deflates, the troupe elongates chords, later lending ballast to the returning, now denser, first theme. As the knight begins to petrify, he sheds his armor and slowly begins to lay down his arms, as if he were beginning to thaw: \u201cBut I think I\u2019d like to be a little lighter / I could try to throw off the iron helmet / And indulge in memories.\u201d Grasping the kite string and joined by his ghost, he faces a storm of percussion, guitars, and saxophone as this wind batters the ears.

Sometimes it's reliable, chugging along smoothly; sometimes you wait so long for it, you fear it'll never come. And it can totally break down, leaving you stuck and lost. Chappell Roan inhabits that last scenario in her surprise summer single, unable to surface from her private purgatory and move on after a failed relationship. She can't stop imagining her green-haired ex all over the city, she bolts when she smells her perfume, she nearly calls out her name while hooking up with someone else. She even vows that if she can't shake off her past soon, she'll flee the urban jungle for the prairies of Saskatchewan. Roan and her co-songwriter, Dan Nigro, proved they were ace storytellers with last year's \"Good Luck Babe,\" and the vivid imagery in their dream-pop stunner \"The Subway\" is a big reason why it's so relatably, palpably devastating. That and Roan's voice, which is perfectly gorgeous in the track's chorus, but reaches skyscraper heights in its coda as she alternates between the lines \"she's got a way\" and \"she got away\" before going full tilt in its final notes.

The Crampton siblings, Elysia and Joshua Chuquimia, revel in DJ tags, vocal samples, bit-crushed synths, experimental renditions of Bolivian music, dance-punk, and plunderphonics on a project where five of its eight tracks span eight minutes or more, all of which fester in the expanse of staggering digital collages. Like a wrestling arc, the Cramptons traffic in long-form storytelling in their Los Thuthanaka songs. \u201cAwila\u201d builds and confounds and builds and confounds; chaotic, gut-spilling percussion and riffs try to detonate through the swelling. We get 12 delirious minutes of a kullawada dance, and every second is spent reaching towards euphoria. When Joshua\u2019s guitar awakens nearly nine minutes in, \u201cAwila\u201d becomes this impossibly overwhelming wash of intensity. By then there\u2019s no turning back. Los Thuthanaka is a challenging album, and \u201cAwila\u201d is a challenging song. To some, all of it sounds like noise thrown on top of noise, nothing more. But there\u2019s magnificence in the Cramptons\u2019 wall-to-wall elementalism, in how a song as crushing and packed as \u201cAwila\u201d traffics in the possible\u2014toeing what fine line exists between explosion and surrender. Yet the song nearly, almost needfully carries on forever. This is what I want music in 2025 to be remembered as: a nauseating, downright suffocating celebration. \u2014 Matt Mitchell"

The song may be a puzzle, but I promise that the pieces are easy to gather\u2014Beckerman tenderly pairs her voice with a finger-picked guitar melody and a string section. There is a moment when she is singing, \u201cAt least I know we had a good time,\u201d where her vocal coils into a falsetto emphasizing the \u201cknow\u201d of it all.

The collab comes at the perfect time for both Larsson and PinkPantheress, as each musician steps into their pop-stardom moment\u2014each with some of the most distinct and realized creative visions out there (Larsson\u2019s 2000s Lisa Frank neon haze; Pink\u2019s plaid-clad, Y2K-preppy chic), and each scoring noms in the Best Dance Pop Recording Grammy category this year. The original \u201cStateside\u201d beat is blown out to headphone-shattering levels in Larsson\u2019s care, adding an overt strutworthiness to the mix. And Larsson\u2019s verse has become nothing short of a vocal stim for me; every line rolls off the tongue in the most satisfying way. \u201cBoots, that\u2019s my ego boost!\u201d C\u2019mon now! Serotonin at its finest. Two pop stars on their supersonic rises coming together to maximize their joint stardom\u2026 What more could you need? \u2014 Cassidy Sollazzo"

Its chorus \u2014 \"I didn't know it was your p---y palace\" \u2014 is still impossible to scrub from our brains. Unlike her doomed relationship, it'll live on forever. \u2014 Tiffany Kelly"

Williams isn't one to hide her feelings, and on this equally beguiling and alluring track, she pours out her criticism like it's honeyed holy water over a false idol. Its purifying burn might not be intended to save so much as reveal the gray scars under all that bought-and-paid-for glitz, but as she sings in the chorus, it's the action of someone who still holds the memory of what could be close.

It\u2019s impossible to get lost in a song like this, because you don\u2019t want to miss a single syllable. Cain sings about the \u201cgirls who are perfect and have everything, yet carry the reputation of town slut,\u201d and pays tribute to one of her favorite songs (and mine), \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d\u2014likely Kim Carnes\u2019 version, not Jackie DeShannon\u2019s (sorry to Jackie). Here are some lines that stuck out to me: \u201cThree years undefeated as Miss Holiday Inn\u201d; \u201cI\u2019ll never be that kind of angel, I\u2019ll never be kind enough to me\u201d; and \u201cHer daddy keeps her in a box but it\u2019s no good.\u201d But I want to highlight the electronics on \u201cFuck Me Eyes,\u201d specifically. No amount of cresting guitars or muscular drums can override the lush, dense tides of synth that decorate the song\u2019s vulnerable exterior. Perhaps this comes as no surprise to you, but Ethel Cain is very, very good at this. \u2014 Matt Mitchell"

The song feels like two, emerging as a swirl of doomy synths and forlorn vocals before quickly morphing into a totally different beast as a raucous live band bursts in to crack things wide open. Benito may be the most-streamed artist in the world , but his young collaborators Los Sobrinos \u2014 playing piano, congas, maracas, trombone, trumpet, and timpani \u2014 are the real stars here.

        "is_usable": true,
        "issue": "none",
        "review": "Rosal\u00eda has never been one to stick to the confines of genre. Ever since the release of her 2017 debut album Los \u00c1ngeles , the Spanish singer has variously applied an earworming melodic pop sensibility to everything from flamenco folk, R&B storytelling and hip-hop swing on 2018\u2019s breakout record El Mal Querer , to bass-driven reggaeton and dembow rhythms on 2022\u2019s Motomami . In an era of cyclical algorithmic slop, the Rosal\u00eda sound is one of attention-grabbing surprises.\n\nNowhere is this capacity to startle more apparent than on her 2025 single Berghain . Featuring frenetic orchestral strings, dramatic choral harmonies, thunderous timpani, signature yearning vocals from Bj\u00f6rk , gritty exclamations from Yves Tumor and leaping coloratura vocals from Rosal\u00eda herself, the track runs at just under three minutes but listens like the baroque drama of a symphonic odyssey.\n\nMuch more than just classical strings embellishing and adding emotion to a radio-friendly pop track, Berghain enthralls because of its slippery nature, sitting somewhere between Vivaldi\u2019s string arpeggiations, an operatic aria and avant-garde pop. It\u2019s a high-wire act, one that reflects the tension of the track itself, forever on the verge of collapsing under the weight of its own grandiosity. The opening strings, played by the London Symphony Orchestra, immediately create a cinematic sense of scene-setting \u2013 an 18th-century period drama \u2013 before the Catalan choir, Escolan\u00eda de Montserrat, deliver histrionic German lyrics (\u201c Seine Liebe ist meine Liebe/ Sein Blut ist mein Blut ,\u201d translated as \u201c His love is my love/ His blood is my blood \u201d). Rosal\u00eda\u2019s piercing soprano then puts us in the frame of a requiem, with a dramatic D minor key mirroring the harmonic DNA of Mozart\u2019s Requiem in D minor , before Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s \u201c divine intervention \u201d vocals transport us to her own world of avant-pop experimentation. Finally, Yves Tumor\u2019s quoting of the Mike Tyson line \u201c I\u2019ll fuck you till you love me \u201d heralds the arrival of pulsing techno kick drums that emulate the cavernous club of the track\u2019s title.\n\nIt\u2019s an almost overwhelming amount of orchestration in such little space. Without following a typical verse-chorus song structure, it might seem easy to become lost in the song\u2019s veering movements. Yet, it\u2019s Rosal\u00eda\u2019s distinctive voice that is both the anchor and the emotive key to the track\u2019s power. Effortlessly descending from a soaring, operatic tone to plaintive Spanish-language lyrics on heartbreak and loss, her vocals guide the listener on this dramatic journey through what seems like a catastrophic breakup (likely the 2023 end of her engagement to Puerto Rican producer Rauw Alejandro).\n\nIn 2025, a year that saw pop dominated by Olivia Dean\u2019s play-it-safe crooning, Taylor Swift\u2019s lacklustre confessional The Life of a Showgirl and Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s conventional songwriting thematics on Manchild , Berghain plays like a delightful outlier. In its leaning towards classical high art, it has more in common with Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s late-90s experimentalism than the radio fodder passing for pop in 2025, while its multilingual lyrics are a riposte to the constant attention given to native-English-language music.\n\nAnd yet, Berghain isn\u2019t a niche pursuit. At the time of writing, the track is running close to 50 million streams, making it undeniably pop by simple virtue of its mass appeal. It\u2019s our song of the year because of the sheer power of its confident maximalism, for having the virtuosity to freewheel through classical and non-classical genre boundaries, and for helping to challenge exactly what we mean by popstars and the music they make today. In an era that can feel terrifyingly dominated by the growth values of streaming services and the capital accumulation of AI, there is hope in listeners flocking to Rosal\u00eda\u2019s distinctly human search for emotion and difference. -- Ammar Kalia"

Implicitly tied in to that is Richard being gay and closeted \u2014 and it\u2019s interesting that John and Carlile start their joint album with two tribute songs devoted to gay musicians who came before them, the other one being a salute to Laura Nyro. In any case, examining the curious case of Little Richard and his angels and demons is an excuse for Elton to do one of the most flat-out rockers he\u2019s written and performed in a very long time, as seen in the \u201cSNL\u201d clip included above.

Oklou calls herself a cage, destined to be hurt by an unnamed other whose roaming spirit she admires. She yearns to be a cloud, a porous vessel that neither constricts nor clasps her object of affection. But she can only achieve cloudhood in music, her voice turning into liquid whimpers over gentle strums, thudding drums, and doubles of herself. And so the song takes flight, a swooning peak to an otherwise ambiently dreamy album. \u2013Kieran Press-Reynolds"

West End Girl, her first album in seven years, is a raw, diaristic account written and produced in 10 days during the end of her marriage to actor David Harbour, whom she divorced earlier this year after learning he had been cheating on her. (As she divulges in the album, he talks her into opening their marriage when she\u2019s away for work, but then goes on to break the rules they set; he also kept a secret apartment, despite owning an insanely beautiful brownstone .) It\u2019s hard to pick a favorite song, especially as Allen designed the album to be consumed beginning to end like a storybook, but the one that\u2019s been stuck in my head is the aptly named \u2018Ruminating,\u2019 an earworm that perfectly captures that wide-awake, obsessing-over-every-detail feeling we all know too well. Allen\u2019s marriage may have crashed and burned, but as she said , \u2018Heartbreak is also a fucking gift,\u2019 especially when it results in music like this.\u201d \u2014 Kayla Webley Adler, deputy editor and features director"

Chicago Four\u201d reveals an almost hypnotic loop of contrasts. It\u2019s as much an industrial synth-pop song as it is a jazz-funk lick. The music is all over the place yet never out of chemistry.

On The Subway, Roan fantasises about moving to the Canadian province to escape a devastating breakup, a reference that prompted the Saskatchewan tourism board\u2019s website and social media to be inundated in the week following its release. The tongue-in-cheek humour buried in lovelorn yearning that inspired it is a hallmark of Roan\u2019s songwriting. She told Vogue that its release was delayed because she found it \u201ctoo painful\u201d, but online her powerhouse cry of \u201c she\u2019s got away \u201d has soundtracked countless uplifting stories of moving on. Awash with dreampop guitars, dramatic violin and percussion juddering like a train, her soaring vocals mine the moments in early-stage heartbreak when even smelling their perfume is enough to send you spiralling. Despite its melancholy introspection, The Subway is a soundtrack for coming out the other side \u2013 a moment of pure cathartic release. -- Sophie Lou Wilson"

Always Been , Finn\u2019s latest, was not only produced by Granduciel, but he and most of his War on Drugs compadres play on the whole thing. While it scratches that itch that\u2019s been getting louder for War on Drugs fans as they await new music, Always Been also provides an intriguing new vessel for Finn\u2019s narrative songwriting. \u201cBethany\u201d was the first song he brought to Granduciel.

The tongue-in-cheek humour buried in lovelorn yearning that inspired it is a hallmark of Roan\u2019s songwriting.
